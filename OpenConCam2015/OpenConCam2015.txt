Why OpenCon Cambridge?
The organisers brought together OpenCon Cambridge because we're passionate about open access, open data and open education and we wanted to:
	* Introduce open in all its many forms
	* Bring people together who want to change things in research, education, public data
	* Make connections and networks in the University (and outside)
	* Take forward actions in Cambridge e.g. groups who want to focus on a certain thing, changes we can ask for internally, training or research that people might be interested in pursuing.

Things you might need to know:
	* Hashtag: #openconcam - keep the comments and questions coming on Twitter
	* Coffee break is at 15:30
	* Wifi code is Ticket: 300-329-490 Password: ki8ce27d
	* We are heading to The Punter after 17:30 http://www.thepuntercambridge.com/map.html

##########################################################################

Cameron Neylon Opening Keynote - Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqZc-bWT9mc

What are your personal motivations for being open?
Cameron Neylon - it contributed to my success, more people were reading what I wrote
Jenny Molloy - I was frustrated as a researcher by lack of access to data but even before that I liked the idea of an open source community and wanted to be part of one, to contribute where I could. I like that open sets up spaces where that is possible.
Michelle Brook - I care about open, because I care about enabling more people to have access to academic information and knowledge. It's about equality and fairness.

Richard Smith-Unna - Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8lwPo75fbg

What did Richard miss out? Do you have other tips from your work or experiences?
More what he included - loved the emphasisi on "making things" not just be about software, but instead about the possibility of making decisions, communities, policies.

Lightning talks!

Max Shinn on Open software for open science - Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfn0xopZnDw
License you work! Choose an appropriate license and add it to your code files, at least minimally and ideally with lawyer friendly language (this is documented)
Who in Cambridge can give advice on software licensing?

Tobey Wenzel on documenting open hardware for science - Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtPstSRzzp0
Our open source software and database talked about are available at DocuBricks.com

Info: There will be a journal soon specifically for Open Source Hardware in an affordable open access formate. When it is out, you will be able to find it here: http://www.ubiquitypress.com/site/journals/

Nicole Janz - Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tavl6ASsyc
Does anyone know of similar workshops elsewhere in Cambridge?
	Sophie Kay delivered a course for the Life Sciences Interface DTP in Oxford http://www.opensciencetraining.com/
	I did a review of some open science training http://science.okfn.org/2014/12/21/open-training-for-open-science/
Would you find this useful in your feild? Would this be a terrible idea because of 
More or less none of the experiment or data analysis scripts I see in Physics are anything like "replicatable".  It would be fantastic fo get all our PhD students (and postdocs and academics - though that's harder!) into the mindset of working in a reproducible way.

Comment by Tobey: DocuBricks can also be used to document a "recipe" to treat or replicate data and soon there will be lables and comment functionalities on the database for successful replications. This is also a key issue for open source hardware, but can be applied to other fields. DocuBricks is general to all documentations, and the scientific hardware projects will be concentrated on OpenLabware.org when it becomes neccessay.

######      What shall we do now? Proposals for projects, activities, meetings
##########################################################################

	*  Promote All Things Open in Cambridge with a webpage, an community
	* Have a post-conf meeting to discuss how we can keep things going
	* Organise regular short (lunch-time) meetings (every 2-3 months)
	* Establish an online presence of local open activists 


##########################################################################
######      Questions for the panel discussion
##########################################################################

	* How include the traditionally "closed" incorporations in their transition to open. Do they have to be "perfect" to be folded into the flock? How do we know their motivations are "pure"?
	* Based on Richard's presentation - how can we ensure mentors and champions are encouraged, appreciated, rewarded (in their career)?
	* Most scientific instrumentation is closed.  How do we open it up, without losing the expertise of our current suppliers and turning PhD students into badly paid technicians?
	* How can the reward system in academia be adjusted to incorporate replication studies? Is there a difference between "original" work and replication?
	* Are there fields that are more or less appropriate for replication studies? Are we creating a generation of "error seekers" who want to bring down big names in the field? Is this a bad thing?
	* Publishing measurement data open is great but how can we make cammercial players (e.g. publishers) to put their finger onto closing gaps in publicaions, e.g. ingrediende missing in chemistry method papers, which is an extermly common problem.
