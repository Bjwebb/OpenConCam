Name: Marta
Surname: Teperek
Short profile: Member of the [Open Data
      Team](http://www.data.cam.ac.uk/open-data-team) at the
      University of Cambridge. I did my PhD in biology and I am
      personally fascinated about open science. I would love open data and open science to become
      the default position everywhere, not only in certain
      disciplines.
      If you have any suggestions of what the University of Cambridge
      might do to make data sharing easier, I would be delighted to
      hear from you.
